# Money-Management

README

Our app is a money management system which tracks  income on a month to month basis, and calculates if certain expenditures are necessary.

We have created three parts: A back-end python program and a visual graph

The back-end python uses natural language processing to distinguish between different styles of text in order to reach a conclusion based on input.

The visual graph uses updated input from the python program to consistently update the graph. The visual graph is a line chart depicting monthly balance across a period 
of time.

The GUI is an interactive platform which allows users to take advantage of our program and efficiently manage their money.
